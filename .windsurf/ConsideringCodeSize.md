# Considering Code Size

This sample project comprises approximately 2,000 lines of code, showcasing real functionality.

## Size Breakdown

A rough breakdown of the codebase could be:

* Basic structure: A typical class with a few methods might span around 50-100 lines of code.
* CRUD operations: Implementing basic CRUD operations for a few entities could take around 200-400 lines of code.
* Business logic: Depending on the complexity, business logic can vary widely, but let's estimate around 300-600 lines for moderate complexity.
* Utility methods: General utility methods might take up around 100-200 lines.
* Error handling: Basic error handling and logging could add another 100-200 lines.

## Features

The codebase is designed to demonstrate a range of features, including data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, as well as more complex business logic and state management. This project serves as a foundation for exploring various aspects of software development, from basic structure to intricate logic.

The codebase should include:

* Several classes (around 10-20)
* Basic CRUD operations for a few entities
* Moderate business logic
* Utility methods
