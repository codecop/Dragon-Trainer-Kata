# Dragon Trainer Evolution Service Try 2

General for exercise:

* how are tests? unsure with AI generated tests
* no users of existing code

---

Questions for this exercise?

1. Is it any good
2. which skill is it?

It is probably a 2-3h exercise in total

E getting into assignment

* 1st idea: use AI to get an idea

What did we do?

Steps

* Discovery
* look at tests
* Set up the test
* Simplest first test
* many options for discussions

Skills

* dissecting the statement (requirements) and understand
* matching the requirements with the code, find relevant places for the domain
  * sifting through the code
  * need to know what a dragon is, what evolve means, what create does etc.
  * not pay attention to other code
  * follow the types
  * look at interactions, e.g. with repository
  * without entry point is hard
* making the Test list (second part of requirements)

All agree the skills are:

* Code Navigieren on foreign code bases
* Follow types and find stuff
* derive from similar structures

TODO:

* needs an entry point OR
* this is a library (this is a RPG maker tool)
* add to requirement: "say half of the change is already done, some types etc."
